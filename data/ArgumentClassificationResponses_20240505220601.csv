3. When the function is evaluated on the imaginary axis (points of the form zi), the output must still be real, since the function maps the entire complex plane to the real axis.

4. Due to the analytic and continuous nature of the function, as the input traverses the imaginary axis, the output must cover the entire real axis. This is because the function must be able to produce every real number as output.

5. The explanation about the Taylor or Laurent series expansion of the function around points on the imaginary axis further supports the conclusion that the function maps the imaginary axis onto the entire real axis.
